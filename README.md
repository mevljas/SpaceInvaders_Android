# SpaceInvaders Android
The goal of the project is to create a video game for the Android operating system. It is based
on the once popular Space Invaders game and contains many improvements. The goal of the
game is to win all the levels by defeating all of the opponents and scoring as many points as
possible. The main purpose of the game is to operate a spacecraft, shoot at the enemies and
avoid their missiles. It consists of three different levels, which the player has to play through.
The game is made in the Java programming language and uses the LibGDX library. It is
optimized for all current screen resolutions and Android versions. The application is available
on the Google Play store.
